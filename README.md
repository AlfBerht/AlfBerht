### :jigsaw: About Me :

I'm a 3D artist. This is the path I chose for myself in 2023. I believe it is my ikegai.
I especially enjoy creating locations, thinking about who is present, what they are thinking and what they are doing. When creating a scene, I always try to understand the person who is there and assume how things would be if I were that character.

In 2023 I graduated with two majors: Graphic Design and Architectural Design.
In 2024, I graduated from a year-long course in 3D Generalist. This step was decisive. During my studies I tried many things and found myself in what I love now.

As a creative person, I of course find myself and other activities that have become my hobbies. In my spare time I paint pictures and write books.
