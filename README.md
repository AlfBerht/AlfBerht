### :jigsaw: About Me :

<div>
 I'm a 3D artist. This is the path I chose for myself in 2023. I believe it is my ikegai.
 I especially enjoy creating locations. When creating a scene, I always try to understand the person who is there and assume how things would be if I were that character.
 
 In 2023 I graduated with two majors: Graphic Design and Architectural Design.
 In 2024, I graduated from a year-long course in 3D Generalist. This step was decisive. During my studies I tried many things and found myself in what I love now.
 
 As a creative person, I of course find myself and other activities that have become my hobbies. In my spare time I paint pictures and write books.
 
 I'm currently working on:
 - A Big Scene from the World of Ruthanne. Everything in this scene I'm creating from scratch. The original purpose of creating this project was to show everything I can do. Now to that I will add to the fact that I already love this project. Although, there is still a lot of work to be done.
 - Writing a new book based on my world of Ruthanne. I'm writing it in Russian and translating it automatically into English. So there may well be some inaccuracies.
 - I try to find at least sometimes time to develop skills in digital art. It's not a priority for me, but I find it quite interesting.
