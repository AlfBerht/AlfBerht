### :jigsaw: About Me :

<div>
Hi! I'm a 3D Environment Artist working with Unreal Engine to create immersive, story-rich game worlds.
With a background in architecture and design, I combine structure and mood in my scenes — from layout and lighting to auto-materials, PCG, and RVT systems.

After several years in tech roles, I transitioned into environment art full-time — combining my technical background with creative vision.
Since then, I’ve built over 15 3D projects, including complete environments, props, and experimental systems — each one helped me grow as an artist and problem-solver.

I recently built a full city environment from scratch, handling everything from composition to LOD optimization. I’m also developing a sky system with two suns, moon phases, eclipse control, and customizable weather.

I'm especially drawn to projects with narrative depth and grounded worldbuilding.
Inspired by games like The Witcher, The Division (first), and The Last of Us, I aim to build worlds that feel alive and emotionally engaging.

Feel free to reach out if you're looking for someone who builds grounded, emotional spaces in Unreal Engine.

:star: Book: Ruthain<br />

*Genre: Dark Fantasy / Psychological Fantasy / Adventure<br />
Format: Novel, author-created series*

*Description:
Salvador was once a powerful vampire and a member of a magical order in his home world. But everything changed when he was thrown into another world a mysterious rift. Here, vampires are not immortal nobles of the night — they are a mutated race. Salvador no longer feels like the creature he once was. He is something else now.
His only companion is a talking shadow named Shadomorph — a being that exists on the edge between reason and instinct. Together, they struggle to survive in a new and dangerous world, filled with anomalies, magic, and creatures that should never have existed. Monsters emerge from rifts, cities fall in seconds, and the truth about the past lies buried in the ashes of lost worlds.
Salvador must uncover the mystery of his new nature, find his place in this strange world, earn the trust of his mentor Leonardo, and discover who he has become — if he’s still himself at all.*
