### :jigsaw: About Me :

I'm a 3D artist. This is the path I chose for myself in 2023. I believe it is my ikegai.
I especially enjoy creating locations, thinking about who is present, what they are thinking and what they are doing. When creating a scene, I always try to understand the person who is there and assume how things would be if I were that character.

In 2023 I graduated with two majors: Graphic Design and Architectural Design.
In 2024, I graduated from a year-long course in 3D Generalist. This step was decisive. During my studies I tried many things and found myself in what I love now.

As a creative person, I of course find myself and other activities that have become my hobbies. In my spare time I paint pictures and write books.


I'm currently working on:
- A Big Scene from the World of Ruthanne. Everything in this scene I'm creating from scratch. The original purpose of creating this project was to show everything I can do. Now to that I will add to the fact that I already love this project. Although, there is still a lot of work to be done.
- Writing a new book based on my world of Ruthanne. I'm writing it in Russian and translating it automatically into English. So there may well be some inaccuracies.
:art: I try to find at least sometimes time to develop skills in digital art. It's not a priority for me, but I find it quite interesting.


I am currently on a job search. So if you find me a suitable candidate, please contact me:
